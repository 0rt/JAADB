It's my first coding project more than 200 lines. The only things I've written before in C was Hello world, so it's kinda carzy to start with something like this, it might be terminate in anytime because I just don't have enough knowledge to code what I want it to be...

It's based on privoxy. The first commit was a MSVC compilable version Privoxy which was ported it from POSIX C library.

Objects:

* A ABP compatible syntax rule but keep most Privoxy feature

* Windows HOOK

* HTTPS filter support

Feature like https suppport needs way more coding knowledge and experience than who I am at the moment, hope the first two step will help me gaim some...
