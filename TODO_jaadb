cascade style is prefer. but should use action cascading pattern or attern cascding action?

action
url1
url2
url2
list(file)


or 
url1
action1
action2
action3

Of course, there is seldom case that one pattern need multiple actions, even rare for action more than three. But since a proxy is connection requestion drive application, it will break down to url case in either way...
